Wow. What a festival, huh, Vicky?

Victor
worriedVic
U-ugh. Please don't talk to me about it. We got pranked more times than I'd care to talk about.

Victoria
normTor
But, hey. Things went way better than last time, huh?

Victor
smileVic
Yeah.

Victoria
sadTor
...

V-Victor, I-I'm sorry for laughing at you when you confessed your love to me.

Victor
worriedVic
It's...It's no problem. I've...I've...

Victoria
And then not even giving you a proper reason for why I turned you down...

Victor
I-I've put th-that-

Victoria
And I didn't even tell you why when we got together.

Victor
yellVic
Victoria, stop! Please.

sadVic
Please don't say anymore.

It-It hurts...It hurts to remember these things...alright? I want to f-focus on how g-good things are now...and forget the past.

Victoria
But you can't forget the past. And I can't take back my actions, no matter what I do.

So I want to clear up the past for you. And change your memory so that your past doesn't hurt you anymore.

*pic of Virgil and Tori when young?
...I believed everything my Dad taught me when I was young.
He told me that the weak were worthless-that they'd only drag me down.
As I grew up, I started to realize that that didn't make any sense. No one's really 'weak.' Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses in different places.
You taught me this, Victor.
Living with you, seeing your moments of weakness...but then your glorious moments of strength. I fell for you so long ago.

Victor
V-Victoria...I-I'm...s-so happy. B-but so confused... Why did you hide this from me?

Victoria
Because even though you showed me that Dad was wrong-I still cared deeply for Dad.
I didn't want to upset him-

**end
Victor
worriedVic
B-but, you didn't know if he was alive.

Victoria
worriedTor
But he could have been!
It's-ugh-it's hard to explain.
Every little thing mattered to me, you know?
SadTor
If I didn't believe in him anymore...he was that much more dead to me.
I wanted him to be alive so, so badly-I was willing to give up so much.

Victor
sadVic
Victoria. I didn't think you'd be the type to live for others.

Victoria
seriousTor
Was that really what I was doing? I live for helping others. Nothing in the whole world gives me more happiness than that.
But it was a difficult time.
worriedTor
I was confused about everything. I wasn't sure if Dad was alive. Whether his outlook on the strong and weak was right. I wasn't even sure if your parents would approve (I know that your Mom... doesn't like me).
It was stressful, so I just... I messed up. And hurt you.

Victor
worriedVic
It's alright...Uhm, sorry, Victoria, but this isn't making these memories any easier for me-

Victoria
seriousTor
I'm not done yet-gimme a second, Victor.
Dad came back, and you two fought.

Victor
asideVic
...He wanted to kill me.

Victoria
No, he wasn't.
Because I would have killed him, first.

Victor
vWorriedVic
Are you saying... that I bring out the worst in you...

Victoria
No. I wanted to speak his language. Justice and eye-for-an-eye or whatever-I needed to send him the message that he can't kill you-immediately.
sadTor
Dad... I love him so much, and he tried so hard to teach me how to be good.
But I realized that if he brings out a side of me that wants to kill... then I had to grow up and help him instead of desperately following him.
Dad was sick in the mind, you know...his own parents mistreated him.

Victor
sadVic
O-oh... I'm sorry.

Victoria
smileTor
Hey. Don't be. You were the one who got me to realize all this, silly.
You're the guy who finally pulled us out of our weird justice outlook and finally start enjoying life.
And you waited for me to tell you this after all these years.

Victor
Uhm...it-it still kinda hurts to remember some of this stuff, though... especially since I know how much you were suffering...

Victoria
But I got stronger out of it. Dad and I both did! So much stronger.
You helped us become the great guys we are today, Victor.

*embrace pic*
Even if it hurts to remember the past, remember that it led up to this beautiful present.

Victor
Haha-but all I care about is spending the future with you.

Victoria
Don't get all cheesy, you cheeky cutey, you. Hey, all my yammering tonight let up some of that pain, right?

Victor
A bit. And that's plenty.
You feel better, too?

Victoria
Yeah...Yes.
Thanks, Beloved.

Thanks for viewing!
